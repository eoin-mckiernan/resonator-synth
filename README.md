## Resonator Synth
This is a midi controlled synthesizer written in Python 3, with the actual resonator and tone generation written in C++, with an wrapper generated by SWIG.
The repository contains all the files needed to build it on a Linux system, with the midi control coming from ALSA.


Requires numpy, mido, pyqt5 and SWIG to build.

This branch is functional, but all resonators are initialised everytime a voice is added or removed.
